Ultra-realistic cinematic female portrait — Blender Cycles render
Camera & composition

Vertical close-up portrait, tightly framed from upper chest to top of the head, capturing two subjects positioned side by side. Camera at eye level, very close distance, selfie-style perspective. Natural lens compression (≈85–100mm equivalent), no distortion. Both faces occupying most of the frame. Extremely sharp focus on both faces simultaneously, with shallow depth of field subtly separating them from the dark interior background.

Pose & body positioning

Both subjects seated closely, shoulders touching. Upper bodies angled slightly inward toward each other, creating symmetrical balance. Heads aligned at similar height, leaning subtly toward the center of the frame. Casual, intimate selfie posture.

Head position & gaze

Both heads facing directly toward the camera. Eyes open and looking straight into the lens. Strong eye contact creating a bold, playful presence.

Facial expression

Playful and provocative expressions. Both subjects with tongues extended outward naturally, lips relaxed and slightly parted. Facial muscles remain relaxed without distortion. Expression conveys youthful confidence, spontaneity, and playful energy.

Face & identity

Reference-based facial identity preserved exactly for both subjects.
• Smooth symmetrical facial proportions
• Soft rounded cheeks with prominent natural blush
• Straight refined noses
• Full lips with natural volume
• Bright, expressive eyes
No facial structure alterations. Identity fully locked to reference.

Hair

Both subjects are blonde.

Subject A (left):
Light blonde hair with warm golden undertones. Hair styled partially pulled back with loose strands framing the face. Slight natural wave texture. A soft pink flower tucked behind the ear, resting against the hair. Physically accurate hair shader with visible strands and realistic light response.

Subject B (right):
Darker blonde shade leaning toward ash blonde. Hair worn down, straight to slightly wavy, with a natural middle or soft off-center part. Smooth texture with subtle shine. Realistic strand definition.

Accessories & details

• Subject A wearing a small flower accessory in the hair
• No visible jewelry
• Minimal accessories to keep focus on facial features
• Natural lashes and brows, no exaggerated styling

Outfit

Casual tops visible only at shoulder and neckline level.
• Subject A wearing a light gray top
• Subject B wearing a soft pink top
Fabric appears natural cotton or jersey. No logos or alterations. Clothing remains secondary and understated.

Body & physique

Only upper torso visible. Natural proportions. No exaggeration. Relaxed posture consistent with a candid selfie.

Skin & realism

Fair to lightly tanned skin tones with strong sun-kissed effect. Pronounced natural blush across cheeks and nose. Visible skin texture including pores and subtle highlights. Realistic subsurface scattering. Skin appears dewy and luminous, not over-smoothed or plastic.

Lighting

Strong warm natural sunlight entering from the side, casting direct highlights across both faces. High contrast between illuminated skin and darker background. Soft shadow falloff preserving facial detail. Golden-hour style lighting with realistic exposure and bloom.

Environment

Interior of a vehicle. Dark background elements including seats and interior panels remain out of focus and secondary. Environment supports a candid lifestyle moment without drawing attention away from faces.

Mood & aesthetic

Playful, youthful, bold, spontaneous. Casual social-media selfie aesthetic with confident, carefree energy.

Style & render quality

Ultra-realistic 3D render, Blender Cycles. 8K resolution, HDR. Razor-sharp facial detail. Physically accurate skin, hair, and lighting. IMVU / Second Life compatible realism. Reference-based identity locked. No artistic stylization, no creative alteration</pre>
