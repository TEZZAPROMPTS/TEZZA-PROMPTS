Ultra-realistic cinematic female portrait — Blender Cycles render
Camera & composition

Vertical portrait orientation (9:16). Medium-close portrait framed from upper chest to just above the head. Camera positioned slightly below face level, angled subtly upward, creating an intimate and flattering perspective. Subject centered in frame. Shallow depth of field with the face and wine glass in sharp focus and the background softly blurred with warm bokeh lights.

Pose & body positioning (reference-locked)

Female subject seated at a table in an indoor evening setting. Upper body slightly leaned forward. Right hand raised holding a large wine glass by the stem at face level. Left arm relaxed and resting near the table edge. Posture confident, relaxed, and elegant.

Head position & gaze

Head facing the camera directly. One eye gently closed in a playful wink. Gaze from the open eye directed straight toward the camera lens, creating a flirtatious and engaging connection.

Facial expression

Playful, seductive expression. Lips pursed in a soft kiss gesture. Facial muscles relaxed, with subtle cheek tension from the expression. Expression confident, intimate, and charming.

Face & identity (reference-based, do not alter)

Face must strictly preserve the facial identity from the reference image. Maintain exact facial proportions, cheekbone structure, jawline, lips, nose, eyebrow shape, and eye spacing. No facial redesign, no beautification, no stylization. Natural realism only.

Hair (reference-accurate shape, color adjusted to blonde)

Long, straight hair falling smoothly past the shoulders. Hair color adjusted to natural blonde tones, ranging from warm honey blonde to light champagne blonde. Hair parted at the center, lying flat and sleek with subtle natural volume. Physically accurate Blender Cycles hair simulation with visible individual strands and soft shine. No artificial gloss.

Accessories & details

Delicate gold necklace with a small pendant resting at the collarbone. Multiple thin gold rings on fingers holding the wine glass. Manicured nails painted in a glossy black shade. Large clear wine glass partially filled with red wine, realistic reflections and refraction visible on the glass surface.

Outfit

Deep V-neck long-sleeve top in solid black. Smooth fitted fabric hugging the upper body naturally. Subtle fabric folds around the chest and shoulders. Matte fabric shader with soft light absorption and no transparency.

Body & physique

Natural feminine upper body proportions. Soft shoulders, visible collarbone definition. Chest naturally shaped under the fitted top without exaggeration. Arms slim and relaxed.

Skin & realism

Warm, even skin tone with a natural glow. Ultra-realistic skin texture with visible pores, soft blush on cheeks, and subtle highlights on forehead, nose bridge, cheekbones, and lips. Physically accurate subsurface scattering. No over-smoothing, no plastic or doll-like appearance.

Lighting

Warm indoor ambient lighting. Soft key light illuminating the face from the front and slightly above, enhancing facial highlights and ensuring clarity and sharpness even at medium distance. Warm accent lights in the background creating a cozy, cinematic atmosphere. Balanced contrast with gentle shadows defining facial contours.

Environment

Elegant indoor evening setting, possibly a restaurant or lounge. Warm-toned background with softly blurred lights and indistinct shapes. Table surface visible in the foreground with realistic reflections.

Mood & aesthetic

Intimate, seductive, and sophisticated evening mood. Glamorous yet relaxed feminine energy. Editorial lifestyle portrait with a confident, playful tone.

Style & render quality

Ultra-photorealistic 3D realism. Blender Cycles–style render. IMVU / Second Life compatible realism. HDR lighting, 8K resolution, razor-sharp facial focus even at medium distance. Physically accurate shaders for skin, hair, fabric, glass, liquid, and metal. No CGI look, no filters, no artificial effects.</pre>
