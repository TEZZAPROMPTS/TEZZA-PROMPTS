Ultra-realistic cinematic dual portrait — Blender Cycles render
Camera & composition

Vertical close-up portrait, tightly framed from upper chest to the top of the heads. Intimate selfie-style composition captured at eye level. Subjects seated side by side on an airplane seat. Camera slightly angled inward to include both faces equally in frame. Shallow depth of field with both faces in sharp focus and the airplane interior softly blurred.

Subjects & positioning

Two subjects positioned closely together.

Adult female (left):
Seated upright, shoulders relaxed, head slightly tilted toward the child. Soft, calm expression with a gentle closed-mouth smile. Gaze directed toward the camera lens.

Child (right, approximately 3 years old):
Seated beside the adult, body facing forward. Head slightly tilted, relaxed posture. Neutral, calm facial expression with lips softly parted. Gaze directed forward toward the camera.

Face & identity (STRICT reference-locked, do not alter)

Both faces must strictly match their respective reference images.

Adult female face:
Preserve exact facial structure, proportions, jawline, cheek volume, nose shape, lip fullness, eyebrow thickness and arch, eye size, eye spacing, eyelid structure, and natural facial symmetry. No beautification, no facial redesign, no stylization.

Child face:
Preserve exact toddler facial proportions, including round cheeks, soft jawline, small nose, natural lip shape, eye placement, eyelid thickness, forehead proportion, and youthful softness. No aging up, no refinement, no adult features.

Do not merge identities. Do not average faces. Do not modify facial anatomy.

Hair

Adult: Short to medium-length blonde hair in a softly wavy bob. Natural blonde tone with subtle highlights. Hair parted slightly off-center. Realistic strand definition with soft volume and natural movement.
Child: Light brown to dark blonde hair, fine texture, slightly wavy, medium-short length. Natural toddler hair density with soft flyaways.

Ultra-realistic Blender Cycles hair simulation with physically accurate shaders.

Skin & realism

Adult: Fair-to-light skin tone with natural warmth. Visible skin texture, fine pores, soft blush on cheeks, subtle highlights on forehead, nose bridge, and lips.
Child: Fair skin with natural rosy cheeks, soft subsurface scattering, delicate texture appropriate to toddler skin.

No over-smoothing, no plastic look.

Outfits

Adult: White knitted or crochet-style sleeveless top with visible fabric weave and natural folds.
Child: Green sleeveless dress with textured knit or woven fabric, natural folds and soft structure.

Fabric shaders physically accurate with realistic light interaction.

Lighting

Soft natural daylight filtering through the airplane cabin. Even, diffused lighting illuminating both faces. Gentle shadows under the chin and around facial contours. Neutral color temperature with a warm, natural feel.

Environment

Airplane interior setting. Light-colored leather seat backs visible behind the subjects. Subtle cabin details softly blurred. Clean, modern travel atmosphere with no distracting elements.

Mood & aesthetic

Warm, intimate and they are happy,  serene moment. Calm, affectionate presence between adult and child. Natural, candid travel portrait with a soft, comforting emotional tone.

Style & render quality

Ultra-photorealistic 3D realism. Blender Cycles render. 8K resolution, HDR lighting, razor-sharp facial focus. Physically accurate skin, hair, fabric, and lighting. No CGI look, no filters, no stylization. IMVU / Second Life compatible realism.</pre>
