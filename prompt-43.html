Ultra-realistic cinematic female portrait — Blender Cycles render

Camera & composition

Vertical portrait orientation (9:16). Medium-close to medium shot framed from upper thighs to just above the head. Camera positioned slightly below chest level, angled upward with a subtle low-angle perspective, enhancing depth and natural body presence. Subject centered in frame with a slight diagonal body orientation. Clean horizon line with open sky occupying the upper portion of the composition. Shallow depth of field with the subject in sharp focus and background softly softened.

Pose & body positioning (reference-locked)

Female subject seated on a sandy beach, one leg bent and raised toward the camera while the other leg extends downward, creating layered depth and a relaxed asymmetrical pose. Upper body slightly leaned forward. Left arm resting near the leg, right arm raised with hand touching the brim of the visor hat. Shoulders relaxed. Posture natural, confident, and calm.

Head position & gaze

Head tilted downward and slightly turned to the side. Face partially obscured by the visor brim, creating a mysterious and elegant composition. Gaze directed downward, not looking at the camera.

Facial expression

Neutral to softly contemplative expression. Lips relaxed and gently closed. Expression serene, calm, and introspective.

Face & identity (reference-based, do not alter)

Face must strictly preserve the facial identity from the reference image. Maintain exact facial proportions, cheek volume, jawline, lips, nose, eyebrow structure, and eye spacing. No facial redesign, no beautification, no stylization. Natural realism only.

Hair (reference-accurate shape, color adjusted to blonde)

Hair gathered into a loose high bun with soft volume. Color adjusted to natural blonde tones ranging from warm honey blonde to light golden blonde. A few subtle flyaway strands visible for realism. Hair texture soft and natural with physically accurate Blender Cycles hair simulation. No artificial shine.

Accessories & details

Wide-brim woven straw visor hat with natural fiber texture and visible weave pattern. Large circular woven earrings with a neutral beige tone. Long almond-shaped acrylic nails in a pastel green shade, glossy but realistic. No additional accessories.

Outfit

Minimalist green bikini set. Bandeau-style bikini top with a small central metallic ring detail, fabric stretched naturally over the chest with realistic tension and folds. Matching bikini bottoms partially visible. Fabric appears smooth, matte, and slightly elastic, with realistic swimwear shader.

Body & physique

Curvy, feminine physique with full thighs, soft abdomen, and naturally shaped chest. Realistic proportions without exaggeration. Visible muscle softness and natural body contours. No distortion.

Skin & realism

Warm medium-tan skin tone. Ultra-realistic skin texture with visible pores, subtle sheen from natural oils and sunlight, and gentle highlights on shoulders, chest, thighs, and arms. Physically accurate subsurface scattering. No over-smoothing or artificial plastic look.

Lighting

Natural outdoor daylight. Soft golden-hour sunlight coming from the side, creating gentle highlights and smooth gradients across the skin. Balanced exposure with no harsh shadows. Sky acting as a soft ambient light source.

Environment

Open beach setting with fine light-colored sand. Clear blue sky dominating the background. Sparse coastal vegetation visible in the distance. Minimalist, serene natural environment with no visual clutter.

Mood & aesthetic

Calm, sensual, elegant summer mood. Relaxed beach lifestyle energy. Sophisticated, natural femininity with a peaceful and intimate atmosphere. Subtle luxury and effortless beauty.

Style & render quality

Ultra-photorealistic 3D realism. Blender Cycles–style render. IMVU / Second Life compatible realism. HDR lighting, 8K resolution, razor-sharp focus. Physically accurate shaders for skin, hair, fabric, straw, and metal. No CGI look, no filters, no artificial effects.</pre>
