Ultra-realistic cinematic female portrait — Blender Cycles render

Camera & composition

Vertical full-body portrait with a slight medium-wide framing, captured from mid-thigh to head. Camera positioned at waist height, slightly angled upward (subtle low-angle), enhancing the sculptural presence of the subject. Subject centered slightly off-axis to the right, with wings extending symmetrically behind her. Shallow depth of field; subject fully in focus while the background fades into deep darkness. Cinematic studio composition with strong subject separation.

Pose & body posture (reference-locked)

The female subject is leaning forward, torso angled downward and forward, supported by both hands placed firmly on a white rectangular pedestal. Arms extended straight but relaxed, elbows unlocked. Fingers spread naturally, with visible tension in the knuckles and tendons due to body weight support.

Hips pushed slightly backward, creating a pronounced curve in the lower back. One knee subtly bent while the other leg supports balance, giving the pose a dynamic, sensual yet controlled stance. Shoulders slightly rolled forward. Neck elongated.

Head turned to the right side, chin slightly lowered, gaze directed sideways and slightly upward, not facing the camera directly. Expression calm, soft, subtly seductive, with relaxed lips and a composed facial demeanor.

Face & identity (reference-based)

Young female face with delicate, symmetrical features. Soft jawline, smooth cheekbones, small straight nose, and naturally full lips. Eyes almond-shaped, looking off-frame with a dreamy, contemplative expression. No exaggerated makeup. Facial proportions and identity preserved exactly from the reference image.

Hair

Long blonde hair with a warm golden tone. Hair styled in loose, voluminous waves cascading over the shoulders and down the back. Front sections softly frame the face. Natural shine and movement, with individual strands visible. Ultra-realistic hair rendering with fine strand detail and soft highlights.

Outfit & accessories

Short satin dress in a soft pastel pink tone. Fabric appears silky and reflective, with visible highlights and folds responding naturally to studio lighting. Dress features thin off-shoulder straps resting low on the arms, exposing shoulders and upper chest. Skirt slightly gathered with natural fabric tension around the hips and thighs.

Large feathered angel wings attached to the back. Wings are dark brown to charcoal gray with soft, layered feathers. Feathers appear dense, fluffy, and organically arranged, with subtle translucency at the edges. Wings partially open, extending outward and upward, framing the subject’s body.

No visible jewelry.

Skin & realism

Fair skin tone with ultra-realistic texture. Visible pores, subtle blush on cheeks, natural highlights on shoulders, arms, and collarbones. Physically accurate subsurface scattering. No plastic or overly smooth appearance. Natural shadowing under arms and along the waist and legs.

Lighting

Cinematic studio lighting with a dark, moody atmosphere. Soft key light from the front-left illuminates the face, shoulders, and upper body. Gentle rim light outlines the wings and hair, creating separation from the dark background. Shadows are soft but defined, enhancing depth and realism.

Environment

Minimal studio environment with a deep black background. White pedestal block with matte texture serving as a physical support element. No additional props or distractions.

Mood & aesthetic

Ethereal, sensual, and elegant mood. The pose conveys vulnerability and strength simultaneously. Angelic fantasy aesthetic grounded in photorealistic execution. Calm, cinematic, editorial atmosphere.

Style & render quality

Ultra-photorealistic 3D realism. Blender Cycles–style render. IMVU / Second Life compatible realism. HDR lighting, 8K resolution, razor-sharp focus. Physically accurate skin, fabric, feather, and hair shaders. No stylization, no CGI look, no filters.</pre>
