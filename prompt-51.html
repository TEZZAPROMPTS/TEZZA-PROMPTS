Ultra-realistic cinematic female portrait — Blender Cycles render
Camera & composition

Vertical medium-full body portrait, framed from mid-thigh to head. Camera positioned slightly above floor level, angled subtly upward toward the subject, creating a gentle low-angle perspective that enhances body lines. Subject placed slightly off-center, leaning against a low platform in front of a plush sofa. Natural lens compression (≈85mm), no distortion. Sharp focus on the subject with background softly detailed. Realistic depth of field.

Pose & body positioning

Subject seated on a low wooden platform or step, torso angled diagonally toward the camera. One leg bent and grounded, the other slightly extended, creating elegant asymmetry. Left arm resting along the thigh with relaxed fingers. Right arm bent, hand lifted near the hair and head, supporting a casual yet sensual pose. Posture confident, relaxed, and poised.

Head position & gaze

Head slightly tilted downward and subtly turned to the side. Eyes looking away from the camera, unfocused and contemplative, creating a candid, editorial mood. Neck elongated naturally.

Facial expression

Neutral to softly sultry expression. Lips gently closed with a natural fullness. Facial muscles relaxed, conveying elegance, calm confidence, and sophistication without exaggeration.

Face & identity

Reference-based facial identity preserved exactly. Symmetrical facial proportions, defined cheekbones, softly contoured jawline, straight refined nose, full lips. Natural glam makeup with warm bronzed tones, soft contouring, subtle blush, and a delicate highlight on cheekbones and nose bridge. No alteration to facial structure.

Hair

Long blonde hair, straight and sleek, falling smoothly past the shoulders. Hair color is a realistic warm blonde with subtle natural highlights and lowlights. Clean center or slight off-center part. Physically accurate hair shader with visible individual strands and realistic light interaction.

Accessories & details

Minimal styling. No visible jewelry. Long, natural-toned manicured nails. Styling remains clean to keep focus on silhouette and textures.

Outfit (STRICTLY reference-based, do not alter):
Clothing must exactly match the provided outfit reference image.
Preserve original colors, fabric type, seams, cut and fit.
Natural fabric stretch and behavior.
No redesign, no color changes, no style alteration.
Outfit must follow the reference precisely.

Body & physique

Slim, curvy physique with defined waist, full hips, and toned arms and legs. Natural anatomical proportions. Subtle muscle definition visible without exaggeration. Feminine, balanced silhouette.

Skin & realism

Warm tan skin tone with physically accurate subsurface scattering. Visible natural skin texture, including pores and subtle tonal variations. Soft glow on shoulders, chest, arms, and legs. No plastic or overly smoothed appearance.

Lighting

Soft, warm indoor lighting with ambient natural light entering from a nearby window. Gentle highlights along the shoulders, chest, and thighs. Shadows remain soft and diffused, enhancing contours without harsh contrast. Cinematic yet realistic illumination.

Environment

Elegant vintage-inspired interior. Plush velvet sofa in warm rust tones with tufted texture in the background. Wooden flooring beneath the subject. White walls with classic window frames and shutters. Patterned rug partially visible. Environment remains secondary but richly detailed and realistic.

Mood & aesthetic

Luxurious, sensual, refined, and editorial. Calm, intimate atmosphere with a high-end lifestyle feel. Effortless elegance and confidence.

Style & render quality

Ultra-realistic 3D render, Blender Cycles. 8K resolution, HDR, razor-sharp focus. Physically accurate materials, lighting, and shadows. IMVU / Second Life compatible realism. Reference-based, identity locked. No artistic stylization or creative alteration.</pre>
