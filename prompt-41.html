Ultra-realistic cinematic female portrait — Blender Cycles render
Camera & composition

Vertical portrait orientation (9:16). Low-to-mid angle camera positioned slightly below waist level, angled upward toward the subject, creating a powerful and editorial perspective. The camera is placed close to the foreground, with a pair of oversized sunglasses held directly in front of the lens, dominating the foreground. The woman’s face is seen sharply through the tinted lens reflection, creating a layered depth effect. Medium-full body framing, capturing from boots to head. Subject positioned slightly off-center to the right. Strong depth separation between foreground (glasses), subject, and background. Shallow depth of field with the reflection and face in sharp focus.

Pose & body positioning

Subject is squatting low, heels flat on the ground, knees bent deeply and angled slightly outward. Torso leaning subtly forward. One arm extended toward the camera holding the sunglasses, elbow slightly bent. The other arm relaxed near the knee, fingers resting naturally. Posture confident, grounded, and fashion-forward. Body turned slightly sideways rather than fully frontal, emphasizing curves and dynamic balance.

Head position & gaze

Head turned subtly toward the camera but not fully frontal. Chin slightly lowered. Eyes locked directly into the lens through the sunglasses reflection, creating intense eye contact. Gaze strong, assertive, and captivating.

Facial expression

Calm, confident, and subtly seductive expression. Lips softly parted, no smile. Expression feels controlled, editorial, and intentional. No exaggeration.

Face & identity (reference-based, do not alter)

Facial identity must strictly match the reference image. Preserve exact facial structure, proportions, cheekbone placement, jawline, nose shape, lips, and eye spacing. No beautification, no reshaping, no stylization. Ultra-faithful likeness.

Hair (natural blonde, realistic)

Natural blonde hair with warm golden undertones. Shoulder-length to slightly longer, softly layered. Loose, natural waves with organic movement. Hair appears gently tousled, with subtle volume and natural flyaways. Individual strands visible. Physically accurate Blender Cycles hair simulation with realistic weight and flow. No artificial shine.

Skin & realism

Warm medium-tan skin tone with natural luminosity. Ultra-realistic skin texture with visible pores, fine skin grain, and subtle tonal variations. Physically correct subsurface scattering. Soft highlights on cheekbones, shoulders, thighs, and collarbone. No smoothing, no plastic effect.

Outfit & accessories

Structured white mini dress with a fitted bodice and subtle seams. Fabric appears slightly matte with realistic folds and tension around the hips and waist. Black knee-high platform boots with thick heels and leather texture. Oversized black sunglasses with yellow-tinted lenses, thick frames, and realistic reflections. Multiple rings on fingers with metallic highlights.

Environment

Modern urban balcony or terrace. Dark vertical metal railings in the background. Light stone or ceramic tiled floor beneath the subject. City architecture softly visible in the distance through rail gaps. Clean, minimal, contemporary setting.

Lighting

Natural daylight coming from the side and slightly above. Soft but directional light creating gentle shadows under the chin, arms, and legs. Warm highlights reflected through the yellow-tinted sunglasses onto the face. Balanced contrast with no harsh clipping.

Mood & aesthetic

Bold, editorial, high-fashion moment. Confident, empowered feminine presence. Modern, urban, and cinematic atmosphere.

Style & render quality

Ultra-photorealistic 3D realism. Blender Cycles render. IMVU / Second Life–level realism. HDR, 8K resolution. Razor-sharp focus on face and reflection. Physically accurate shaders for skin, hair, fabric, leather, metal, and glass.
No CGI look. No filters. No doll effect. No stylization.</pre>
